<p class="text">Minnie Mouse is an animated, anthropomophic charracter, created by the 
<br>greats Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney by 1928. Minnie is known to be the 
<br>girlfriend to Micky Mouse, and a close friend to Daisy Duck and a friend
<br> to Clarabelle Cow. Minnie is classy, cheerful, and feminine. She is so 
<br>kind, and careful that is why we all loved her as kids.</p>
